This list is in the following format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"majors\" : [\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\":\"Computer Science Major/Specialist/Minor\",\r\n    \"requirements:\":[\r\n      \"CSC148\",\r\n      \"CSC165\",\r\n      \"MAT135\",\r\n      \"MAT136\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\":\"Computer Science Major/Specialist/Minor\",\r\n    \"requirements:\":[\r\n      \"CSC148\",\r\n      \"CSC165\",\r\n      \"MAT137\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis data structure visualized (from [json 2 html](http://json.bloople.net/)):\r\n\r\n![visualized](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/master/json-visual.png)\r\n\r\nSome programs can have different courses that allow entry (i.e. MAT135/136 vs. MAT137), so the same POST may result from different first year courses. The list of programs and requirements reflects this\r\n\r\n## [Programs not included in the application (for now) due to complicated requirements](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/issues/1):\r\n  - Any program without specific first year requirements\r\n  - Geoscience Major/Minor\r\n  - Earth and Environmental Systems Major\r\n  - Ethics, Society and Law Major (Based on breadth reqs.)\r\n  - International Relations Specialist (Only some variants of the reqs.)\r\n  - Forest Conservation Science Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Forest Conservation Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Environmental Geography Specialist/Major (\"Pick any two courses\")\r\n  - Human Geography Specialist/Major/Minor (\"Pick any two courses\")\r\n  - Physical and Environmental Geography Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Geographic Information Systems Minor\r\n  - Urban Studies Specialist/Major/Minor (Pick selections of different courses)\r\n  - Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations Specialist/Major/Minor (Many many different combos)\r\n  - Peace, Conflict and Justice Specialist/Major (Type 3 with many many requirements)\r\n  - Physiology Major/Minor (\"Pick any of the following\")\r\n\r\n## [Programs that need to be added](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/issues/2):\r\n  - Sociology Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - South Asian Studies Minor\r\n  - Spanish Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Statistics Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Applied Statistics Specialist\r\n  - Women and Gender Studies Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Construction\r\n  - Program design is fairly simple\r\n  - Takes sanitized input of first year courses from a user, and organizes them into an array\r\n    - For example, a user may enter:\r\n      MAT137Y, CSC148H, csc165h, ita100\r\n    - The application will interpret this as:\r\n      ```\r\n      [\"MAT137\", \"CSC148\", \"CSC165\", \"ITA100\"]\r\n      ```\r\n  - Passing this data into our algorithm, we compare the user's input with data from the [list of programs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/master/majors.json)\r\n  - If a programs `\"requirements\"` are entirely contained in the input, that program's `\"name\"` is added to the list of programs returned to the user when the program terminates\r\n  - Repeat the previous step until the list of programs has been exhausted\r\n  - Display the list of programs that the user qualifies for\r\n  - For our example above, this list would be:\r\n  \r\n    ```\r\n    Computer Science Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n\r\n    Italian Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n\r\n    European Studies Major (Italian)\r\n\r\n    Statistics Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n\r\n    Applied Statistics Specialist\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## [Possible improvements](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/issues/3)\r\n  - Filtering (i.e. if a user did not take any math courses there is no point searching through programs that require math)\r\n",
