This list is in the following format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"majors\" : [\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\":\"Computer Science Major/Specialist/Minor\",\r\n    \"requirements:\":[\r\n      \"CSC148\",\r\n      \"CSC165\",\r\n      \"MAT135\",\r\n      \"MAT136\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\":\"Computer Science Major/Specialist/Minor\",\r\n    \"requirements:\":[\r\n      \"CSC148\",\r\n      \"CSC165\",\r\n      \"MAT137\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis data structure visualized (from [json 2 html](http://json.bloople.net/)):\r\n\r\n![visualized](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/master/json-visual.png)\r\n\r\nSome programs can have different courses that allow entry (i.e. MAT135/136 vs. MAT137), so the same POST may result from different first year courses. The list of programs and requirements reflects this\r\n\r\n## Problematic Programs (requirements don't work with the JSON):\r\n  - Any program without specific first year requirements\r\n  - Geoscience Major/Minor\r\n  - Earth and Environmental Systems Major\r\n  - Ethics, Society and Law Major (Based on breadth reqs.)\r\n  - International Relations Specialist (Only some variants of the reqs.)\r\n  - Forest Conservation Science Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Forest Conservation Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Environmental Geography Specialist/Major (Pick any two courses)\r\n  - Human Geography Specialist/Major/Minor (Pick any two courses)\r\n  - Physical and Environmental Geography Specialist/Major/Minor\r\n  - Geographic Information Systems Minor\r\n  - Urban Studies Specialist/Major/Minor (Pick selections of different courses)\r\n  - Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations Specialist/Major/Minor (Many many different combos)\r\n  - Peace, Conflict and Justice Specialist/Major (Type 3 with many many requirements)\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\n\r\nMajor Finder is open source and released under the [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/master/LICENSE)\r\n",
